# Html parser

**WIP - work in progress, use at your own risk**

A simple and general purpose html parser, using [Pest](https://pest.rs/).

## What is it not

- It's not a high-performance browser-grade parser
- It's not 100% complient with html
- It's not a parser that includes node selection or dom manipulation

If your requirements matches any of the above, then you're most likely looking for any of the following crates:

- [html5ever](https://crates.io/crates/html5ever)
- [kuchiki](https://crates.io/crates/kuchiki)
- [scraper](https://crates.io/crates/scraper)
- or other crates using the `html5ever` parser

## Features

- Parse html document
- Parse html fragments
- Parse custom, non-standard, elements
- Doesn't include comments in the AST
- Removes dangling elements

## Examples

#### Parse html document

```rust
    use html_parser::HtmlParser;

    fn main() {
        let html = r#"
            <!doctype html>
            <html lang="en">
                <head>
                    <meta charset="utf-8">
                    <title>Html parser</title>
                </head>
                <body>
                    <h1 id="a" class="b c">Hello world</h1>
                    </h1> <!-- dangling nodes are removed -->
                </body>
            </html>"#;

        assert!(HtmlParser::parse(html).is_ok());
    }
```

#### Parse html fragment

```rust
    use html_parser::HtmlParser;

    fn main() {
        let html = "<div id=cat />";
        assert!(HtmlParser::parse(html).is_ok());
    }
```

#### Print to json

```rust
    use html_parser::{HtmlParser, Result};

    fn main() -> Result<()> {
        let html = "<div id=cat />";
        let json = HtmlParser::parse(html)?.to_json_pretty()?;
        println!("{}", json);
        Ok(())
    }
```
